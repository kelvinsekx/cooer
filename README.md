# cooer

This will be update in progress...

Cooer is a monolithic file of both backend and client.
check "./server/express.js" to see the running server for both backend and client side

## Graphql
Cooer's api is a restAPi wrapped around graphQL. This is intentional to enable both flexibility with either the use of graphQL or a Rest.
Visit "./graph" folder to see the graphql changes. 
Also graphQL enables better appreciation of backend data .. you can hit "[baseURL]/graphql" to play with cooer data. If you aren't new to
graphql, it is a quick start.

## Development
You can simple clone this repo and use `npm install` to get started. The package.json is well explanatory trust me. If everything is fine, a printout of what url to hit will appear on your terminal.
